# Todo

* instructions
* a heap more levels
  * 1 - 5 really basic
  * 6 - 10 mid level
  * 10+ whatever
  * 3 introduce unmovable tiles
  * 6 introduce multiple tracks
* colours for more than two tracks or trains
* maybe the tiles need an outline to make it obvious where the edges/borders are?
* banner image needs some fixing maybe - some of it is a bit wonky
* the trains.js is just ridiculous, maybe split out the curved vs straight logic into their own methods
