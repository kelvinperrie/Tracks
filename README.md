# Tracks

I don't know what this. It started out as a way to see if I could join train-track-like things together and then have something move along those tracks. It kind of turned into a game.

## Todo

* a heap more levels
* colours for more than two tracks or trains
* banner image needs some fixing maybe - some of it is a bit wonky
* the trains.js is just ridiculous, maybe split out the curved vs straight logic into their own methods
